Step 4 - Deploy the Raven Dashboard
===================================

First, navigate to the /raven-dashboard subdirectory under
/raven-platform.

::

   # If you are in the Raven Mapper Export component directory, first use...
   cd ..

   # Otherwise, from the Raven Platform directory navigate to the Raven Dashboard with...
   cd raven-dashboard

Configuring the Dashboard
-------------------------

Unlike the other components, the environment variables are set in the
.env file you should find at the dashboardâ€™s root directory. Two
variables will be defined. For your local deployment, ensure they are as
follows aside from any changes you need to make to reflect deviations
from this tutorial.

::

   FHIR_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/raven-fhir-server/fhir
   MAPPER_EXPORT_URL=http://localhost:8081/raven-import-and-submit-api/

Running the Dashboard in Docker
-------------------------------

As with other components, the Dashboard is provided in a Docker
container which can be built and run with the following commands.

::

   sudo docker build -f Dockerfile.local -t raven-dashboard . 
   sudo docker run -d -p 80:80 --network=raven-platform --name raven-dashboard --restart unless-stopped raven-dashboard:latest

After the container is ran, you should be able to browse to
[[http://localhost:80/app/cases]] and see the browse cases view of the
Raven Dashboard. If you previously loaded a case through the health
check portion of the Raven Mapper Export component step you should see
this case reflected here, otherwise the list will be empty.

**Congratulations, you have successfully deployed the Raven Platform!**
