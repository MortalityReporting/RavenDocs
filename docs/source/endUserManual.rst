End User Manual
===============

In this section, you can learn how to use and *run* the Raven platform. 
You can think of Raven as a playground or sandbox. Each structure has its own function and feature 
that a user can *play* with or even put your hands in dirt if the user wants. In Raven, you can *run* 
and *play*.

*Are you non-technical?*
If you are a non-technical end user, then we recommend you to go to ":ref:`mdiStandard`" page first and learn about
