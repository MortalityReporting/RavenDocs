Validation And Comparison
=========================
The MDI (Medicolegal Death Investigation) Validator is a web application that allows users to upload or copy-paste their MDI FHIR IG data for validation. The MDI Validator uses the HL7 FHIR validator as a core validation engine and provides a user interface (UI) wrapper that is tailored to the MDI IG.  
  
The Comparison Tool is a connectathon supporting tool that will compare pre-validated test case MDI FHIR IG data with the user generated FHIR data. Users will want to ensure that not only their data validated but also their contents in FHIR correctly populated. The Comparison Tool will provide a compressed case view with side by-side comparison of the imported record and the correct test case record. This will let users easily hone in on individual content issues and have confidence in their process.
